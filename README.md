# Take-home Project

## Project Description

The Take-home project is a web application developed using React, TypeScript, and Vite. It serves as a template that provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some ESLint rules.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Vite**: A build tool that provides a fast development environment for modern web projects.
- **ESLint**: A tool for identifying and fixing problems in JavaScript code.

## Instructions for Running or Viewing the Landing Page

### Option 1: Viewing Online

If the project is hosted (e.g., on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel), you can view it by visiting the live URL (if available).

### Option 2: Running Locally

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BlueMadnessVG/Take-home.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```
   cd Take-home
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies**:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the development server**:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

This will start the Vite development server and provide a local URL (typically http://localhost:3000) where you can view the application.

## Additional Information

- **Responsive Design**: The page adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Customization**: Easily customizable by modifying the CSS and HTML files.
